## Javascript Capstone 
#### This project was to build a website that allows user to manage their to-do list. It was done by using api calls to Node.js REST API.

The pages are as follows -

- A home page named index.html that highlights our "Stay Organized" web site.
   - ![Home Page](https://github.com/Bhawna-Bhatt/StayOrganized/assets/167182332/97f9a732-75cf-4137-9764-b1edbc6be18d)

  
- A page that allows you to view all of the ToDo tasks for a user by picking the user from a dropdown.  The page will be named user-todos.html
    - ![Todos](https://github.com/Bhawna-Bhatt/StayOrganized/assets/167182332/44e8450b-2182-4844-bb2d-0a73edb00078)

- A page that allows the user to add a ToDo task named new-todo.html
